Title: Tools for qPCR
Description: RT-qPCR is a widely used method to detect the expression level of genes in 
  biological research. A crucial step in processing qPCR data is to calculate 
  the amplification efficiency of genes to determine which method should be used 
  to calculate expression level of genes. This Package can do it easily. 
  In addition to that, this package can calculate the expression level of genes 
  based on three methods.
